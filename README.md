# Gabriel's Electronics & PCB Projects Collection

Welcome to Gabriel's collection of various printed circuit board projects! These designs originated from various industrial electronics, IoT & robotics projects that were further refined. These were developed for permanent deployment, prototyping, testing or automated development. 

Specifically, these projects either:
- comprise the major aspect/component of an R&D project
- comprise the custom designed PLC of a machine
- belong to a part of an automation tool or process
- form a part of an automated prototyping workbench
- host an interconnect communication system for robotics applications
